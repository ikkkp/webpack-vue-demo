# Webpack & Vue.js Example

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic application using Webpack and Vue.js.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webpack-vue-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd webpack-vue-example
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

## Usage

### Development

To start the development server and see changes in real-time, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Production Build

To build the project for production, use:

```
npm run build:prod
```

This will generate minified and optimized files in the `dist` directory.

## Basic Example

This example includes a simple Vue component. You can find the component in `src/components/HelloWorld.vue`. To use this component, import it into your desired file and include it in your template:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import HelloWorld from "@/components/HelloWorld.vue";

export default {
  components: {
    HelloWorld,
  },
};
</script>

<style>
/* Add your styles here */
</style>

```
